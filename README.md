# Images Originally From:

# Images Edited Phase:
The original images from the Stanford Dogs Dataset were taken and processed by Alex and Grace. They located the dog in each image and returned a cropped version of the image, that is focused only on the dog.

## CSCI-470: Introduction to Machine Learning
This data is for my team's final project. We noticed that there were issues
with the data. For
example, inside toy terriers the photo, n02087046_7214, is
an image of something other than a toy terrier. Thus, we are going to fix the inconsistencies and remove photos that will throw off the Machine Learning. For example, a dog wearing a bee costume.
